This is the SML Autohooker, a tool that generates a header file that has a hookable function definition for every single function in the EXE.
Most people don't need to use this, it's mostly just for me (SuperCoder) to use whenever Satisfactory updates.
Required tools:
* Python 3.0+
* Patience as you wait for everything to decompile
Steps:
1. Make a folder in the directory where you found this named "data".
2. Get FactoryGame-Win64-Shippinhh.pdb and put it in the data folder.
3. Using an *ADMINISTRATOR* Command Prompt or Powershell run the command "regsvr32 msdia140.dll" without the quotes.
4. Run the command "SML_AutoDumper.exe -s .\data\FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.pdb" without the quotes. This will take a long time to finish.
5. Run SML_AutoHooker.py with Python 3.0 or higher.
6. Pray that everything generated properly and can compile.
